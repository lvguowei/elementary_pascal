# Elementary Pascal - Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes

This repository contains programs in the book.

There are 2 reasons I picked this "outdated" book now.
1. Learning pascal to a point that I can read **Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs** by Niklaus Wirth.
2. Finding some fun material to learn programming with the kid in the future.
